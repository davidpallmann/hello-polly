# Hello, Polly!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Polly!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-polly) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Polly and Text-to-Speech. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Polly and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to perform Text-to-Speech. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Polly Project

After getting familiar with Amazon Polly in the AWS console, you'll write a .NET 6 console program that converts text or SSML to synthesized speech, saved as an MP3 file.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
